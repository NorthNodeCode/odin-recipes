    <h2>About this dish</h2>
    <p>
      This is my own dish that I have concoted for gym usage. It is
      <strong>bloody <em>delicious</em></strong> and comes in at a
      <strong>whopping 60g of protein for around 500 calories.</strong>
      Trust me, you could eat this every day for dinner and still be happy.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 steroided-up chicken breast</li>
      <li>Potatos</li>
      <li>Your own spices, and msg</li>
      <li>Air fryer</li>
      <li>Frozen Veg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to cook</h3>
    <p>
      Alright, now it's time to cook. Don't forget, you need to have marinated
      the chicken in whatever spices you'd like. Come on now, you don't expect
      me to tell you how to marinate the chicken now do you?
      <strong>I ain't got time for that.</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hard boil the potatos for 20 minutes on until fork tender.</li>
      <li>
        Put the potatos in the air fyer on 200c for 15 minutes - if you have a
        removable rack, put them under neath so the fat from the chicken will
        drip onto it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now put the chicken in there at 200c for 15-20 minutes flipping halfway
      </li>
      <li>While that's cooking, boil/steam your frozen veg</li>
      <li>Plate it up once cooked.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <em>Voila! </em>Enjoy it hot, that chicken gonna be
      <strong><em>juicy</em></strong
      >!
