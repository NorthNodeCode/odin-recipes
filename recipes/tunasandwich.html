    <h2>About this sandwich</h2>
    <p>
      This sandwich honestly is pretty <strong><em>shit</em></strong
      >. It's just a regular tuna sandwich, with 2 cans instead of one for that
      extra protein <strong>punch.</strong>
      <p><em>Nevertheless, let's make this baby.</em></p>
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pieces of bread</li>
      <li>2 cans of tuna</li>
      <li>Some mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make this</h3>
    <small>come on now, its a god damn sandwich</small>
    <ol>
      <li>Get your bread out</li>
      <li>Open the cans and put the tuna in a bowl</li>
      <li>
        In said bowl, put the mayo in and your seasoning of choice. If you don't
        know what, I like to put some salt and pepper and whatever else I have
        on hand, and some lemon juice too
      </li>
      <li>Mix throughly and spread it over the bread</li>
      <li>Assemble the sandwich</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <em>Voila!</em>
      You have now made a tuna sandwich.
      <strong>Well done!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>You are now a world class chef!</p>
